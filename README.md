## System Overview
A two-dice oracle system for solo and GM-less roleplaying games, combining standard yes/no outcomes with scale shifts and detail focus effects.

### Components
- Two six-sided dice (2d6)
- Die 1: Outcome Die (Yes/No)
- Die 2: Modifier Die (Modifiers and Special Effects)

### Core Mechanics

#### Die 1 (Outcome)
- 1-3: No
- 4-6: Yes
- Special Marks:
  - ⭐ on 1 and 6
  - ★ on 3 and 4

#### Die 2 (Modifier)
- 1,6: AND (&) - Enhances/intensifies result
- 2,5: BUT (B) - Adds twist/complication
- 3,4: No modifier (blank faces)
- Special Marks:
  - ⭐ on 5 (B) and 6 (&)
  - ★ on 3 and 4 (only relevant when matching Die 1)

### Special Effects

#### Scale Shifts (⭐+⭐)
Occurs when ⭐ symbols match (8.34% chance):

1. Pure Scale Up (2.78%)
   - Matching & with ⭐
   - Natural expansion of current situation

2. Complex Scale Up (5.56%)
   - Matching B with ⭐
   - Expansion with twist/complication

#### Detail Focus (★+★)
Occurs only on exact matches (3,3 or 4,4):
- Reveals specific detail about situation
- Base Y/N result determines if detail is helpful or complicating

### Probability Distribution

| Result | Chance | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Y& | 16.67% | Enhanced success |
| YB | 16.67% | Success with complication |
| Y | 16.67% | Simple success |
| N& | 16.67% | Enhanced failure |
| NB | 16.67% | Failure with benefit |
| N | 16.67% | Simple failure |

Special Effects Probabilities:
- Scale Shifts: 8.34% total
  - Pure Scale (& match): 2.78%
  - Complex Scale (B match): 5.56%
- Detail Focus (★ match): 5.56%
