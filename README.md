# 2d6 Oracle System

## Core Mechanics

### Base Resolution
- **Die 1 (Outcome)**: Determines Yes (4-6) or No (1-3)
- **Die 2 (Modifier)**: Adds detail to outcome
  - & (1,6): Enhances the result
  - B (2,5): Adds a twist
  - Blank (3,4): No modification

### Special Effects

#### Expansions (⭐ Matches)
When ⭐ symbols match (8.34% chance):

1. **Dramatic Expansion** (2.78%)
   - Occurs with & modifier
   - Expands scope significantly
   - Intensifies current situation
   - Example: Finding a map leads to discovering an entire lost civilization

2. **Complex Expansion** (5.56%)
   - Occurs with B modifier
   - Expands scope with complications
   - Introduces new elements
   - Example: Finding a key reveals a vast conspiracy

#### Detail Focus (★ Matches)
- Occurs only on exact matches (3,3 or 4,4)
- Reveals specific important detail
- Base result (Y/N) determines if detail helps or hinders

## Result Types
